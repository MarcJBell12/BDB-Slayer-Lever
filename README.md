# BDB-Slayer-Lever
This is a location for the lever CAD file I set up based on Qporzk's water knob file! I've tried it out, and it works quite well with FDM printing, but I have not tried any other materials nor can I make any guarantees. I tried to set the lever similar to how the steam lever looks and operate. Let me know if you try it and find any issues. Thanks and good luck!
