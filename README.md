# BDB-Slayer-Lever
This is a location for the lever CAD file I setup based on Qporzk's water knob file! I've tried it out, works quite well with FDM printing, but I have not tried any other materials. I tried to set the lever similar to how the steam lever looks and operate, with Let me know if you try it and find any issues.
